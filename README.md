Cross-platform 2D graphics.

The Piet project consists of a core crate (`piet`) which describes a 2D graphics API,
and a number of "backends", which implement that API on top of the built-in
2D graphics system of a given platform. This allows the same drawing code to be
used on different platforms, without having to bundle a full 2D renderer.

The motivation for this crate is set forth in this [blog post]. It is used as
the basis of [Druid], a cross-platform GUI toolkit.

A companion for BÃ©zier path representation and geometry is [kurbo].

## Getting started

Running the examples requires that submodules be checked out. From the root
directory, run

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

## Backends

*For cross-platform use, the [`piet-common`][] crate reexports the most
appropriate implementation for the current target.*

#### `piet-cairo` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-cairo)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-cairo)

The `piet-cairo` crate depends on the [cairo library][]. A simple test of the cairo
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image file called `cairo-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-coregraphics` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-coregraphics)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-coregraphics)

The `piet-coregraphics` crate works on macOS only. A simple test of the coregraphics
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image file called `coregraphics-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-direct2d` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-direct2d)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-direct2d)

The `piet-direct2d` crate works on Windows only. A simple test of the direct2d
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image called `d2d-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-svg` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-svg)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-svg)
#### `piet-web` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-web)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-web)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! It's in early stages, so there are lots of opportunities to fill things out.

You can find other collaborators at [xi.zulipchat.com][zulip] under the #druid stream.

## Inspirations

Piet's interface is largely inspired by the [Skia Graphics Library] as well as
the [C++ 2D graphics api proposal] although piet aims to be much more lightweight and modular.

## The Name

The library is named after [Piet Mondrian]. It is abstract and intended to
be used for drawing lots of rectangles.
