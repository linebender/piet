This repo holds an API for 2D graphics drawing.

The motivation for this crate is set forth in this [blog post].
Ideally it will become a layer to help [druid] become cross-platform.

This repo is structured as a core API crate, "piet" and a separate crate for each back-end.
One motivation for this structure is that additional back-ends can be written without coupling
to the main crate, and clients can opt in to the back-ends they need. In addition,
it's possible use multiple back-ends, which will likely be useful for testing.

A companion for BÃ©zier path representation and geometry is [kurbo].

## Backends

*For cross-platform use, the [`piet-common`][] crate reexports the most
appropriate implementation for the current target.*

#### `piet-cairo` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-cairo)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-cairo)

The `piet-cairo` crate depends on the cairo library, found at
https://www.cairographics.org/download/. A simple test of the cairo
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image file called `cairo-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-coregraphics` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-coregraphics)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-coregraphics)

The `piet-coregraphics` crate works on macOS only. A simple test of the coregraphics
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image file called `coregraphics-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-direct2d` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-direct2d)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-direct2d)

The `piet-direct2d` create works on Windows only. A simple test of the direct2d
backend is to run `cargo run --example test-picture 0`, which should
produce an image called `d2d-test-0.png`.

#### `piet-svg` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-svg)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-svg)
#### `piet-web` [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/piet-web)](https://crates.io/crates/piet-web)

## Roadmap

Since the project is in its infant stages, there's not currently a set roadmap. For a good idea of what the library will eventually be capable of see [this list][resvg backend requirements] of requirements to be a backend 2D graphics library for the SVG rendering library resvg.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! It's in early stages, so there are lots of opportunities to fill things out.

You can find other collaborators at [xi.zulipchat.com][zulip] under the #druid stream.

## Inspirations

Piet's interface is largely inspired by the [Skia Graphics Library] as well as the [C++ 2D graphics api proposal] although piet aims to be much more lightweight and modular.

## The Name

The library is of course named after [Piet Mondrian]. It's abstract and hopefully will be used for drawing lots of rectangles.
