/// ## Line Breaks
///
/// A text layout may be broken into multiple lines in order to fit within a given width. Line breaking is generally done
/// between words (whitespace-separated).
///
/// When resizing the width of the text layout, calling [`update_width`][] on the text layout will
/// recalculate line breaks and modify in-place.
///
/// A line's text and [`LineMetric`][]s can be accessed line-by-line by 0-indexed line number.
///
/// Fields on ['LineMetric`] include:
/// - line start offset from text layout beginning (in UTF-8 code units)
/// - line end offset from text layout beginning (in UTF-8 code units)
/// - line trailing whitespace (in UTF-8 code units)
/// - line's baseline, distance of the baseline from the top of the line
/// - line height
/// - cumulative line height (includes previous line heights)
///
/// The trailing whitespace distinction is important. Lines are broken at the grapheme boundary after
/// whitespace, but that whitepace is not necessarily rendered since it's just the trailing
/// whitepace at the end of a line. Keeping the trailing whitespace data available allows API
/// consumers to determine their own trailing whitespace strategy.
///
/// ## Text Position
///
/// A text position is the offset in the underlying string, defined in utf-8 code units, as is standard for Rust strings.
///
/// However, text position is also related to valid cursor positions. Therefore:
/// - The beginning of a line has text position `0`.
/// - The end of a line is a valid text position. e.g. `text.len()` is a valid text position.
/// - If the text position is not at a code point or grapheme boundary, undesirable behavior may
/// occur.
